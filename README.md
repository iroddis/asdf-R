        1. ```sudo apt-get install build-essential libcurl3-dev libreadline-dev gfortran```

```

## ASDF options

Check [asdf](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf) readme for instructions on how to install & manage versions of R.

When installing R using `asdf install`, you can pass custom configure options with the following env vars:

* `R_CONFIGURE_OPTIONS` - use only your configure options
* `R_EXTRA_CONFIGURE_OPTIONS` - append these configure options along with ones that this plugin already uses

## Using RStudio

RStudio requires building R shared library, in order to do that pass an extra configure option to `asdf install`:

```R_EXTRA_CONFIGURE_OPTIONS=--enable-R-shlib asdf install R <version>```
